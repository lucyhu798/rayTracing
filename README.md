5. We tried to implement a 5x5x5 uniform grid acceleration structure and managed to run scene1 with all camera angles but no other scenes would render correctly. This may be due to how we build the grid and dealt with grid intersections.
6. We finished the basic implementations based on Ravi's CSE 167 course, but Danny has not taken CSE 167 with Ravi and didn't have the base source code. Thus, it took a while to get used to the code base and fix the incomplete CSE 167 code base from last quarter. In addition, our implemenation of uniform grid was inspired by the link https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-acceleration-structure/grid, where it detailed the basis of uniform grid. We may implement either Uniform or BVH in the future due to the complexity and improvement in rendering but time has not allowed it so for this assignment.
